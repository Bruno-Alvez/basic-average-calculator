# Basic Average Calculator

This was one of my very first programming exercises. I developed this simple average calculator as part of my early studies in logic and JavaScript.

Although it’s a basic project, it represents an important step in my learning journey, where I focused on:

- Understanding variables and data types
- Practicing conditional structures
- Writing clean and readable code
- Structuring a simple HTML/CSS layout

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this project was to calculate a student's average grade based on input values, providing immediate feedback on whether the student passed or failed.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 📚 What I learned

- How to manipulate user input using JavaScript
- DOM interactions for dynamic feedback
- Basic page structure and styling

## 🧠 Reflection

Even though I now work with more advanced stacks like React, Node.js, Django, and Go, I keep this project public to show the starting point of my journey — where curiosity and dedication led me to pursue a full-stack development career.
